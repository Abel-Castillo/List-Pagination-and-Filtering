# List Pagination and Filtering

A list of students information is displayed in a single page.

Only using vanilla JavaScript to create pagination to enhance the usability of the web page.

For this project the only allowed file to modify was the js/script.js file, no changes where allowed in the HTML file.

In additon an input search bar was created to generate the search results with pagination included. If no user found then an error will be displayed in place of the student list.
